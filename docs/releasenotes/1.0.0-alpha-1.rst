alligator 1.0.0-alpha-1
=======================

:date: 2020-09-04

This release modernizes the codebase, and drops Python 2 as well as
Beanstalk/``beanstalkc`` support.


Changes
-------

* Removed Beanstalk support. (SHA: `368db30`)

    `Note:` This is due to the lack of Python 3 support in the ``beanstalkc``
    library. If this changes in the future, we'll re-evaluate adding it back
    in.

* Updated the SQS backend to `boto3`. (SHA: `ee80d69` & `c6fd671`)


Bugfixes
--------

* Changed ``Task.async`` to ``Task.is_async``, due to ``async`` being a
  reserved word in modern Python 3. (SHA: `bf98511`)
* Updated all dependencies to more current versions. (SHA: `1d368e3`)
* Fixed the Redis backend's tests. (SHA: `e793aa9`)
* Fixed the worker process to correctly exit during testing. (SHA: `9b7b486`)
