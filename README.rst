Simple offline task queues. For Python.

`"See you later, alligator."`

Latest documentation at http://alligator.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.


Requirements
------------

* Python 3.6+
* (Optional) ``redis`` for the Redis backend
* (Optional) ``boto3>=1.12.0`` for the SQS backend


Basic Usage
-----------

This example uses Django, but there's nothing Django-specific about Alligator.

I repeat, You can use it with **any** Python code that would benefit from
background processing.

.. code:: python

    from alligator import Gator

    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    from django.shortcuts import send_email


    # Make a Gator instance.
    # Under most circumstances, you would configure this in one place &
    # import that instance instead.
    gator = Gator('redis://localhost:6379/0')


    # The task itself.
    # Nothing special, just a plain *undecorated* function.
    def follow_email(followee_username, follower_username):
        followee = User.objects.get(username=followee_username)
        follower = User.objects.get(username=follower_username)

        subject = 'You got followed!'
        message = 'Hey {}, you just got followed by {}! Whoohoo!'.format(
            followee.username,
            follower.username
        )
        send_email(subject, message, 'server@example.com', [followee.email])


    # An simple, previously expensive view.
    @login_required
    def follow(request, username):
        # You'd import the task function above.
        if request.method == 'POST':
            # Schedule the task.
            # Use args & kwargs as normal.
            gator.task(follow_email, request.user.username, username)
            return redirect('...')


Running Tasks
-------------

Rather than trying to do autodiscovery, fanout, etc., you control how your
workers are configured & what they consume.

If your needs are simple, run the included ``latergator.py`` worker:

.. code:: bash

    $ python latergator.py redis://localhost:6379/0

If you have more complex needs, you can create a new executable file
(bin script, management command, whatever) & drop in the following code.

.. code:: python

    from alligator import Gator, Worker

    # Bonus points if you import that one pre-configured ``Gator`` instead.
    gator = Gator('redis://localhost:6379/0')

    # Consume & handle all tasks.
    worker = Worker(gator)
    worker.run_forever()

Running Tests
-------------

Alligator has 95%+ test coverage & aims to be passing/stable at all times.

If you'd like to run the tests, clone the repo, then run::

    $ virtualenv -p python3 env
    $ . env/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements-tests.txt
    $ python setup.py develop
    $ pytest -s -v --cov=alligator --cov-report=html tests

The full test suite can be run via:

    $ export ALLIGATOR_TESTS_INCLUDE_SQS=true
    $ ./tests/run_all.sh

This requires all backends/queues to be running, as well as valid AWS
credentials if ``ALLIGATOR_TESTS_INCLUDE_SQS=true`` is set.


WHY?!!1!
--------

* Because I have NIH-syndrome.
* Or because I longed for something simple (~375 loc).
* Or because I wanted something with tests (90%+ coverage) & docs.
* Or because I wanted pluggable backends.
* Or because testing some other queuing system was a pain.
* Or because I'm an idiot.


Roadmap
-------

`1.0.0`:

    * Stable release of all the alpha/beta code
    * Committing to backward-compatibility in the 1.X series

Post-`1.0.0`:

    * Expand the supported backends
        * Kafka?
        * ActiveMQ support?
        * RabbitMQ support?
        * ???
